JSON :
 The JSON.stringify() method is used to convert a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string. JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text-based format that uses key-value pairs.

 JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space) :
 value: The JavaScript object or value to convert to a JSON string.
 replacer: An optional function that is called for each property of the object to be converted. 
 space: An optional string or number that specifies the indentation of the output


const users = require('./MOCK_DATA.json');
